Implementing Machine Learning Models on Wine Dataset_In_Python

I use a wine dataset and perform K Nearest Neighbor, Decision tree, Random forest, Gradient boosting, and Neural network Machines techniques
to predict whether a wine is white or Red. 

The goal of this study is to predict whether a wine is white or red using K Nearest Neighbor, Decision tree, Random forest, Gradient boosting,
and Neural Network Machines techniques. Furthermore, I compare models and recommend the best machine-learning models based on accuracy, precision, 
and recall benchmarking metrics. 

In this study, I cleaned the data and performed descriptive analysis to better understand the data. Analysis conducted on the data revealed a positive
connection between alcohol content and the quality of the wine. Higher levels of alcohol were associated with a better quality of the wine. 
However, an increase in density, chlorides, and volatile acidity resulted in a decrease in the quality of the wine. Outliers in variables of residual sugar,
free sulfur dioxide, and total sulfur dioxide were treated by using the median. 

In order to improve the model's accuracy, a new variable was added that split quality into three groups: low, medium, and high. Feature scaling was then 
done and the data was split into test and training datasets. Different algorithms such as K Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting,
and Neural Network Machines were used to predict whether the wine was white or Red. The accuracy of KNN was 99.23% with a Precision rate of 99.59% and 
recall of 99.38%. the accuracy of the decision tree model was 97.15% with a Precision rate of 97.8% and recall of 98.87%. the accuracy of the Random forest 
model was 99.30% with a Precision rate of 99.39% and recall of 99.69%. the accuracy of the gradient boosting model was 98.84% with a Precision rate
of 98.59% and recall of 99.89%. the accuracy of the neural network model was 99.61% with a Precision rate of 99.69% and recall of 99.79%. As a result, 
although all machine learning models gave us a very good accuracy, the neural network model predicted wine better than other models with the highest accuracy,
precision, and recall, hence I recommend this machine learning model for predicting wine types.
